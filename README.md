## Overview
This is an artifical intelligence application that is used to predict electricity consumption. Based on the data, which is read from the excel file, the model is trained. After the training, it is possible to test the model in a certain period of time on the basis of new data that is read from Excel and then write the prediction results in csv format.

Used C# programming language, .NET, Entity Framework for database, WPF for frontend and Keras API for artificial neural networks.

## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2019
* Python 3.7
* Install Keras, numpy and Tensorflow.
* Can be problem with CPU, so you change in configuration manager in Visual Studio to your CPU be x64 based.
